# Exploring the Weather in Athens

This repository serves as a basic demonstration of data analysis for the needs of the Software Eningineering in Practice course offered by the [Department of Management Science & Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/el/dmst) of the Athens University of Economics and Business, supervised by Mr. Panos Louridas.

In this assignment I explored the weather in Athens over a period of more than 50 years, producing meaningful graphs and plots, as well as interpretations of them.
